This is the last lesson for the home row! The G and H keys are typed with the index finger on each hand and are the first "reaches" you will learn. G is typed by reaching the left index finger while H is typed with the right. Make sure to return your fingers when you are done with each reach, and try to move your other fingers as little as possible during another fingers' reach.
