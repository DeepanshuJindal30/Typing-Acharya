Letters are important, but to actually type, it is important to know the shift key! The shift key, a type of "modifier" key, capitalizes letters or shifts a key to its secondary symbol. To use the shift key, hold the shift key down with the pinky of the opposite hand of the letter you are typing. Make sure that when you type the letter down, the shift key is held down. Make sure to release the shift key before typing another key!
